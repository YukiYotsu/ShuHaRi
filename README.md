# 🥋 What is SHUHARI?
SHUHARI is an event organized by Japanese youth based in Europe,
celebrating expression and dialogue. It will take place in May 2025, featuring
over 50 creatives, involving a range of workshops, performances, exhibitions,
talks and authentic Japanese food stalls.
By holding space for young people to express and share Japanese culture,
we aim to deepen intercultural exchange and to lay the groundwork for
future international business opportunities. The event is held in cooperation
with the Japanese-German Center Berlin and the Tobitate! (Leap for
Tomorrow) JAPAN Scholarship Program by the Japanese Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). We are
currently seeking sponsorships from companies and organizations that share
our vision, through both financial and in-kind support.
